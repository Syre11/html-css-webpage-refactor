# html-css-webpage-refactor

## Description

This project was started to practice and learn the application of semantic meaning within HTML and CSS. It started with an HTML and CSS starter files with no semantic meaning and was built by adjusting the semantic elements within the HTML file to add meaning. The CSS sheet then was updated to match the new semantic elements. The process of this project taught me the purpose of giving semantic meaning to a webpage.
